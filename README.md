# EduTech

EduTech is a fully functional EdTech platform that enables users to create, consume, and rate educational content. The platform is built using the MERN stack, which includes ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and ExpressJS.

## Introduction

EduTech aims to provide a seamless and interactive learning experience for students, making education more accessible and engaging. Additionally, the platform serves as a platform for instructors to showcase their expertise and connect with learners across the globe.

## System Architecture

The EduTech platform consists of three main components: the front-end, the back-end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front-end serving as the client and the back-end and database serving as the server.

### Front-end

The front end of EduTech has all the necessary pages that an ed-tech platform should have. Some of these pages are:

**For Students:**

- **Homepage:** This page will have a brief introduction to the platform, as well as links to the course list and user details.
- **Course List:** This page will have a list of all the courses available on the platform, along with their descriptions and ratings.
- **Wishlist:** This page will display all the courses that a student has added to their wishlist.
- **Cart Checkout:** This page will allow the user to complete the course purchase.
- **Course Content:** This page will have the course content for a particular course, including videos, and other related material.
- **User Details:** This page will have details about the student's account, including their name, email, and other relevant information.
- **User Edit Details:** This page will allow the student to edit their account details.

**For Instructors:**

- **Dashboard:** This page will have an overview of the instructor's courses, as well as the ratings and feedback for each course.
- **Insights:** This page will have detailed insights into the instructor's courses, including the number of views, clicks, and other relevant metrics.
- **Course Management Pages:** These pages will allow the instructor to create, update, and delete courses, as well as manage the course content and pricing.
- **View and Edit Profile Details:** These pages will allow the instructor to view and edit their account details.

### Back-end

The back end of EduTech provides a range of features and functionalities, including:

- **User authentication and authorization:** Students and instructors can sign up and log in to the platform using their email addresses and password. The platform also supports OTP (One-Time Password) verification and forgot password functionality for added security.
- **Course management:** Instructors can create, read, update, and delete courses, as well as manage course content and media. Students can view and rate courses.
- **Payment Integration:** Students will purchase and enrol on courses by completing the checkout flow that is followed by Razorpay integration for payment handling.
- **Cloud-based media management:** EduTech uses Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service, to store and manage all media content, including images, videos, and documents.
- **Markdown formatting:** Course content in document format is stored in Markdown format, which allows for easier display and rendering on the front end.
